# Pastezi

An attempt to create a pastebin site that does not suck. https://paste.zi.fi/

* Automatic paste of text into editbox (if you give permission)
* Automatic copy of link after saving
* The usual keyboard shortcuts for save/open/copy
* No line numbers etc. get copied (even if you manually paint them or Ctrl+A)
